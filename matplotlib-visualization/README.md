# Matplotlib Visualization Basics

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **Matplotlib**, focusing on core data visualization concepts in Python.  
The goal of this project is to understand how plots work at a fundamental level, without using higher-level libraries.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

The notebook demonstrates the following visualizations using Matplotlib:

- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Bar charts
- Histograms
- Pie charts
- Subplots (multiple plots in a single figure)
- Plot customization:
  - Titles
  - Axis labels
  - Legends
  - Figure size
- Saving plots as images

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas (used only for basic data loading, not visualization)

## 📝 Notes

- This repository **focuses only on Matplotlib fundamentals**.
- Seaborn and other visualization libraries are intentionally excluded to keep the scope clear.
- The notebook is structured for learning and clarity, not for competition or production use.
