## 📂 Folder Overview

### 🔹 `numpy/`
Practice notebooks covering NumPy fundamentals, including:
- Arrays and array operations
- Indexing and slicing
- Vectorized computations
- Numerical problem-solving

---

### 🔹 `pandas_practice/`
Data analysis exercises using Pandas, focusing on:
- Loading and inspecting datasets
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Filtering, grouping, and aggregation
- Exploratory analysis using real datasets (e.g., Titanic dataset)

---

### 🔹 `matplotlib/`
Core **data visualization using Matplotlib**, covering:
- Line plots
- Scatter plots
- Bar charts
- Histograms
- Pie charts
- Subplots and layout management
- Plot customization (titles, labels, legends)

This folder focuses **strictly on Matplotlib fundamentals** to build a strong visualization foundation.

---

### 🔹 `mini-projects/`
A collection of small Python projects designed to apply core programming concepts:

- **expense-tracker**  
  A simple console-based application to track and manage expenses.

- **library-book-rental-system**  
  A basic system to manage book rentals, demonstrating file handling and control flow.

- **login-system**  
  A user authentication system implementing input validation and conditional logic.

- **marks-manager**  
  A program to manage and process student marks.

- **notes_manager**  
  A notes management application using file operations.

- **text-utilities**  
  Utility programs for common text processing tasks.

These projects emphasize **logic building, modular code, and real-world problem thinking**.

## 📌 Notes

- Each folder is intentionally focused on a **single concept or library**
- Projects prioritize clarity and fundamentals over optimization
- Visualization is learned using Matplotlib before higher-level libraries
