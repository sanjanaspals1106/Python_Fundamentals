# 📊 Pandas Practice Notebook

This repository contains my **hands-on Pandas practice** using a real-world dataset.  
The goal of this notebook is to strengthen core data manipulation skills using Python and Pandas.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Dataset:** Titanic Passenger Data
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **File:** `data/titanic.csv`

The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## 🛠️ Concepts Practiced

The notebook demonstrates the following Pandas concepts:

- Loading CSV data using `read_csv`
- Basic data exploration (`head`, `info`, `describe`)
- Row filtering using conditions
- Column selection
- Grouping data using `groupby`
- Aggregations (mean, count, sum)
- Creating new columns
- Using `apply()` for row-wise operations
- Sorting and summarizing results
